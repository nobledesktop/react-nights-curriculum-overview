# React Curriculum

## Overview

This curriculum is designed to teach students the fundamentals of React. It is broken down into four units: Beginning React, Intermediate React, Advanced React, and Full Stack React. Each unit is broken down into multiple sections, most of which are designed to roughly fit a 6-hour class. All sections have a lesson and, time permitting, an assignment. The curriculum is designed to be taught in order, as each lesson builds on the previous one.

## How To Use This Repository

Each unit in the Syllabus below has a link to the repository for that unit's curriculum. This document and the unit repositories are designed to be used together and will always be kept in sync. **For instructors and curriculum engineers**, this means that you can make changes to the curriculum in the unit repositories and then update this document to reflect those changes--being sure to update the night class' curriculum document as well. **For students**, this means that you can use this document as a guide to the curriculum, and then use the unit repositories to access the actual curriculum content.

Instructors will typically keep these unit repositories public and accessible to students until the end of each unit, after which they will be made private. This is to prevent students from accessing future curriculum content before it is taught--order is important for properly building the concepts of this material for learners. Please be sure to download any content you need before the units are made private. Alternately, you can fork the repositories to have your own personal copies you can access at any time. And, of course, you can always request access to a past repository from your instructor.
